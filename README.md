# Python Console Games and Bank App

This repository is a collection of Python console applications, including engaging console games and a functional bank application. Each project within this repository is designed to demonstrate practical implementations of Python programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, database management with SQLite, and game development. Featured games include Blackjack, Pong (playing against the computer), and the classic Snake game. Additionally, the bank application showcases the use of validators and database operations for managing user accounts and transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with these applications, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. These applications are tested with Python 3.8 and above. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies

This project depends on several external libraries, including `tabulate` for pretty-printing table outputs and `sqlite3` for database operations. To install these dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
pip install tabulate sqlite3
